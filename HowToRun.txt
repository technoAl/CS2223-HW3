To execute the files for this HW. (Only .java files included from original Intellij project)
1. Open the folder regarding the question to be graded
2. Keep all the java files in a folder together in the same package (default package works!) (Specicifically applies to Question 5, where each sort is it's own class)
3. Execute the main of the java Question1.java to see results. 
4. Originally run with path "./cats/data". The cats folder is in the project folder NOT the source folder.
5. Feel free to run on other data/change or move the files, just change the path in the code to match
